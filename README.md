# Dermatology Clinic Web Application
Healthy Beauty Dermatology Clinic Project

As part of my studies at Esprit University, I developed a project for Healthy Beauty, a dermatology clinic offering dermatologist consultations and sessions with various specialists.

This application is designed to streamline clinic operations by:

=> Improving Access to Patient Files: Doctors can easily access and manage patient files for more efficient consultations.

=> Enhancing Product and Complaint Management: The administration can better handle product inventory and manage patient complaints seamlessly.

=> Empowering Patients: Patients can easily submit, delete, or modify complaints, enhancing their engagement with the clinic.

The application leverages a modern tech stack—JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and PHP—connected to an SQL database, ensuring secure and efficient data management for all users.
